Note: for better experience, you need to use [Yandex Maps API][1]. Here, you need to obtain the Geosuggest API, but you can try a different one as it's free to use.

### Setup:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

```
VITE_YANDEX_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
